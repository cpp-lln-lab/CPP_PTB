This is the Crossmodal Perception and Plasticity lab (CPP) PsychToolBox (PTB) toolbox.

Those functions are mostly wrappers around some PTB functions to facilitate their use and their reuse (#DontRepeatYourself)

## Requirements

Make sure that the following toolboxes are installed and added to the matlab / octave path.

For instructions see the following links:

| Requirements                                             | Used version |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| [PsychToolBox](http://psychtoolbox.org/)                 | >=3.0.14     |
| [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) | >=2015b      |
| or [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)        | 4.?          |

Tested:
-   matlab 2015b or octave 4.2.2 and PTB 3.0.14.

## Documentation

All the documentation is accessible [here](./docs/00_index.md).

```

## How to install

### Download with git

``` bash
cd fullpath_to_directory_where_to_install
# use git to download the code
git clone https://github.com/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_PTB.git
# move into the folder you have just created
cd CPP_PTB
```

Then get the latest commit to stay up to date:
```bash
# from the directory where you downloaded the code
git pull origin master
```

To work with a specific version, create a branch at a specific version tag number
```bash
# creating and checking out a branch that will be called version1 at the version tag v1.0.0
git checkout -b version1 v1.0.0
```

### Add as a submodule

Add it as a submodule in the repo you are working on.

``` bash
cd fullpath_to_directory_where_to_install
# use git to download the code
git submodule add https://github.com/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_PTB.git
```

To get the latest commit you then need to update the submodule with the information
on its remote repository and then merge those locally.
```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

Remember that updates to submodules need to be committed as well.

#### Example for submodule usage

So say you want to clone a repo that has some nested submodules, then you would type this to get the content of all the submodules at once (here with my experiment repo):
``` bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/user_name/yourExperiment.git
```
This would be the way to do it "by hand"

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/user_name/yourExperiment.git

# go into the directory
cd yourExperiment

# initialize and get the content of the first level of submodules  (CPP_PTB and CPP_BIDS)
git submodule init
git submodule update

# get the nested submodules JSONio and BIDS-matlab for CPP_BIDS
git submodule foreach --recursive 'git submodule init'
git submodule foreach --recursive 'git submodule update'
```

### Direct download

Download the code. Unzip. And add to the matlab path.

Pick a specific version:

https://github.com/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_PTB/releases

Or take the latest commit (NOT RECOMMENDED):

https://github.com/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_PTB/archive/master.zip

### Add CPP_PTB globally to the matlab path

This is NOT RECOMMENDED as this might create conflicts if you use different versions of CPP_PTB as sub-modules.

Also note that this might not work at all if you have not set a command line alias to start Matlab from a terminal window by just typing `matlab`. :wink:

```bash
# from within the CPP_PTB folder
matlab -nojvm -nosplash -r "addpath(genpath(fullfile(pwd, 'src'))); savepath(); path(); exit();"
```

## Code style guide

We use the `camelCase` to more easily differentiates our functions from the ones from PTB that use a `PascalCase`.

In practice, we use the following regular expression for function names: `[a-z]+(([A-Z]|[0-9]){1}[a-z]+)*`.

> Regular expressions look scary but are SUPER useful to sort through filenames:
> - A quick [intro to regular expression](https://www.rexegg.com/)
> - And many websites allow you to "design and test" your regular expression:
>   - [regexr](https://regexr.com/)
>   - [regexper](https://regexper.com/#%5Ba-z%5D%2B%28%28%5BA-Z%5D%7C%5B0-9%5D%29%7B1%7D%5Ba-z%5D%2B%29)
>   - ...

We keep the McCabe complexity below 15 as reported by the [check_my_code function](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/check_my_code) or the [MISS_HIT code checker](https://florianschanda.github.io/miss_hit). A couple of code quality metrics are also checked automatically by MISS_HIT (avoiding functions with too many nested `if` blocks).

We use the [MISS_HIT linter](https://florianschanda.github.io/miss_hit/style_checker.html) to automatically fix some linting issues.

The code style and quality is also checked during the [continuous integration](./.travis.yml).

## Unit tests

Unit tests are run with the mox unit toolbox and automated with github action on Octave.
