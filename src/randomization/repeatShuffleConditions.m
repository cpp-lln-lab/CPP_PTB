function shuffledRepeats = repeatShuffleConditions(baseConditionVector, nbRepeats)
    %
    % Given ``baseConditionVector``, a vector of conditions (coded as numbers),
    % this will create a longer vector made of ``nbRepeats`` of this base vector
    % and make sure that a given condition is not repeated one after the other.
    %
    % USAGE::
    %
    %   shuffledRepeats = repeatShuffleConditions(baseConditionVector, nbRepeats)
    %
    % :param baseConditionVector:
    % :type baseConditionVector: vector
    % :param nbRepeats:
    % :type nbRepeats: integer
    %
    % :returns: - :shuffledRepeats: (vector) (dimension)
    %

    % TODO
    % - needs some input checks to make sure that there is actually a solution
    % for this randomization (e.g having [1 1 1 1 1 2] as input will lead to an
    % infinite loop)
