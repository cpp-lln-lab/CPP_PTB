function templateFunctionExample()
    % This function illustrates a documentation test defined for MOdox.
    % Other than that it does absolutely nothinghort description of what
    % the function does goes here.
    %
    % Examples:
    %   a=2;
    %   disp(a)
    %   % Expected output is prefixed by '%||' as in the following line:
    %   %|| 2
    %   %
    %   % The test continues because no interruption through whitespace,
    %   % as the previous line used a '%' comment character;
    %   % thus the 'a' variable is still in the namespace and can be
    %   % accessed.
    %   b=3+a;
    %   disp(a+[3 4])
    %   %|| [5 6]
    %
    %   % A new test starts here because the previous line was white-space
    %   % only. Thus the 'a' and 'b' variables are not present here anymore.
    %   % The following expression raises an error because the 'b' variable
    %   % is not defined (and does not carry over from the previous test).
    %   % Because the expected output indicates an error as well,
    %   % the test passes
    %   disp(b)
    %   %|| error('Some error')
    %
    %   % A set of expressions is ignored if there is no expected output
    %   % (that is, no lines starting with '%||').
    %   % Thus, the following expression is not part of any test,
    %   % and therefore does not raise an error.
    %   error('this is never executed)
    %
    %
    % % tests end here because test indentation has ended
