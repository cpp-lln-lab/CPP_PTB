function responseEvents = getResponse(action, deviceNumber, cfg, getOnlyPress)
    %
    % Wrapper function to use ``KbQueue`` which is definitely what you should use
    % to collect responses. You can easily collect responses while running some
    % other code at the same time.
    %
    % The queue will be listening to key presses on a keyboard device:
    % ``cfg.keyboard.responseBox`` or ``cfg.keyboard.keyboard`` are 2 main examples.
    %
    % When no ``deviceNumber`` is set then it will listen to the default device.
    %
    % You can use it in a way so that it only takes responses from certain keys and
    % ignore others (like the triggers from an MRI scanner).
    %
    % Check the ``CPP_getResponseDemo`` for a quick script on how to use it.
    %
    % USAGE::
    %
    %   responseEvents = getResponse(action, deviceNumber, cfg, getOnlyPress)
    %
    % :param action: Defines what we want the function to do
    % :param deviceNumber: device number of the keyboard or trigger box in MRI
    % :type deviceNumber: integer
    % :param cfg:
    % :param getOnlyPress: if set to true the function will only return the key presses and will not
    %                      return when the keys were released (default=true). See the section on
    %                      `Returns` below for more info
    %
    % :returns:
    %
    % - :responseEvents: returns all the keypresses and return them
    %                    as a structure with field names that make it easier
    %                    to save the output of in a BIDS format
    %
    %   - ``responseEvents.onset`` this is an absolute value and you should substract
    %     the "experiment start time" to get a value relative to when the experiment was started.
    %
    %   - ``responseEvents.trial_type = response``
    %
    %   - ``responseEvents.duration = 0``
    %
    %   - ``responseEvents.keyName`` the name of the key pressed
    %
    %   - ``responseEvents(iEvent,1).pressed`` if
    %
    %      - ``pressed == 1``  --> the key was pressed
    %      - ``pressed == 0``  --> the key was released
    %
    % ---
    %
    % ``action`` options:
    %
    % - ``init`` to initialise the queue.
    %   Initialize the buffer for key presses on a given device (you can also
    %   specify the keys of interest that should be listened to).
    %
    % - ``start`` to start listening to the key presses (carefully insert into your
    %   script - where do you want to start buffering the responses).
    %
    % - ``check`` checks all the key presses events since 'start', or since last 'check'
    %   or 'flush' (whichever was the most recent)
    %
    %   - can check for demand to abort if the ``escapeKey`` is listed in the Keys of interest
    %
    %   - can only check for demands to abort when ``getResponse('check')`` is called
    %     so there will be a delay between the key press and the experiment stopping
    %
    %   - abort errors send specific signals that allow the catch to get them and allows us
    %     to "close" nicely
    %
    % - ``flush`` empties the queue of events in case you want to restart from a clean queue
    %
    % - ``stop`` stops listening to key presses
